# lightbox_js
The well known but original old LightBox with some enhancements.

The oldy but well known javascript LightBox with no dependencies that helped us in the '2000s to create simple but effective photo galleries.
This is a version adapted and corrected for a better cross-browser support, responsive and with capacities for multilanguage. Minified within Babel JS to follow the new generation of coding.
